The violence of the front feels far away to Henry Gaunt, Sidney Ellwood and the rest of their classmates, safely ensconced in their idyllic boarding school in the English countryside. News of the heroic deaths of their friends only makes the war more exciting.<br><br>Gaunt, half German, is busy fighting his own private battle--an all-consuming infatuation with his best friend, the glamorous, charming Ellwood--without a clue that Ellwood is pining for him in return. When Gaunt's family asks him to enlist to forestall the anti-German sentiment they face, Gaunt does so immediately, relieved to escape his overwhelming feelings for Ellwood. To Gaunt's horror, Ellwood rushes to join him at the front, and the rest of their classmates soon follow. Now death surrounds them in all its grim reality, often inches away, and no one knows who will be next.<br><br>An epic tale of both the devastating tragedies of war and the forbidden romance that blooms in its grip, <i>In Memoriam </i>is a breathtaking debut.",

But no spy ring was ever unearthed at Oxford. Because one never existed? Or because it was never found...?</p><p>2022: Former spy Simon Sharman is eking out a living in the private sector. When a commission to delve into the financial dealings of a mysterious Russian oligarch comes across his desk, he jumps at the chance.</p><p>But as Simon investigates, worrying patterns begin to emerge. His subject made regular trips to Oxford, but for no apparent reason. There are payments from offshore accounts that suddenly just... stop.</p><p>Has he found what none of his former colleagues believed possible, a Russian spy ring now nestled at the heart of the British Establishment? Or is he just another paranoid ex-spook left out in the cold, obsessed with redemption?</p><p>From Oxford's hallowed quadrangles to brush contacts on Hampstead Heath, agent-running in Vienna and mysterious meetings in Prague, A Spy Alone is a gripping international thriller and a searing portrait of modern Britain in the age of cynical populism. Perfect for readers of Charles Cumming, Mick Herron and John le Carré.</p>",

The first of the three books in this collection (actually Orlando King - the book is a collection of 3 novels) is about the eponymous lead character who comes to England in the 1930s (from an island existence in Brittany). Living a fairly charmed life he seems to effortlessly make progress at work, love and life and soon becomes an MP. The book ends at the start of the 2nd world war when things aren't going quite so well for Orlando.\n\nSo the less good\na) the author appears to trying to create a unique writing style and her big idea is to change the focus of the novel (in terms of characters, location and time) between sentences! Not just between chapters or even paragraphs! Read one sentence and then wonder what the hell the next sentence is all about. One whole mark out of five docked from the rating for this monstrosity of an idea\nb) there's an irritating Introduction by someone called Melissa Harrison who provides unnecessary spoilers while claiming \"These are not spoilers... Isabel Colegate intends the Greek myths of Oedipus and Antigone to be evident from the first page\". As it happens, I do remember quite a bit of the Oedipus story but YES there are spoilers in the introduction. So do yourself a favour and don't read it. Another whole mark out of five docked from the book rating.\n\nAs can be seen, the book may have got a great rating from me otherwise!",

In a time of bread riots and hunger marches, with the spectre of Fascism casting an ever lengthening shadow over Europe, Orlando glidingly cuts a swathe through the thickets of business, the corridors of politics, the pleasure gardens of the Cliveden set, acquiring wealth, adulation, a beautiful wife, and a seat in Parliament. But the advent of war brings with it Orlando's downfall; and his daughter Agatha, cloistered with him in his banishment, is left to pick through the rubble of his smoking, ruined legacy. <br> <br>Elegant and muscular, powerful and razor-sharp, <i>Orlando King </i>is a bildungsroman, Greek tragedy and political saga all in one; a glittering exorcism of the inter-war generation's demons to rival the work of Evelyn Waugh and Muriel Spark.",

It's another \"whole life\" novel following key periods in the life of the lead character (Cyril Avery) - much like many of William Boyd's novels.\n\nThis story follows the life of Cyril from his birth just after the end of the second world war though to his dotage 70 plus years later. He comes from an unusual family and the novel follows the struggles, loves and losses of his personal life. What makes this novel great is the way it sucks you in such that you care care for the lead character and his friends and family.\n\nWhile there are (no real spoiler) lots of tragic losses in Cyril's life it is also a book of great humour. Indeed, towards the end of the novel there are scenes where John Boyne really does seem to be playing it for laughs (and it works well!).\n\nAs I was reading the book, I couldn't help thinking how much of the author's life was in Cyril's life so I found it a real plus that John Boyne ends the book with half a dozen pages explaining just that.\n\nA book that fully deserves the rare \"great\" rating in The Cloudy Book Club.!",

I'm pretty certain Gregory puts lots of research into the retelling of the key historical events in the book. While aware of the Bloody Asizes I learnt a lot about their background.\nHowever, the storylines and dialogue for the books characters isn't quite in the same league, for me, as (say) a William Boyd or Eli Shafak novel. \nIt's still very much wort a read though.",

The spellbinding Fairmile series continues as the fiercely independent Alinor and her family find themselves entangled in palace intrigue, political upheaval, and life-changing secrets in seventeenth-century England.</b><br><br> It is 1685 and England is on the brink of a renewed civil war. King Charles II has died without an heir and his brother James is to take the throne. But the people are bitterly divided, and many do not welcome the new king or his young queen. Ned Ferryman cannot persuade his sister, Alinor, that he is right to return from America with his Pokanoket servant, Rowan, to join the rebel army. Instead, Alinor and her daughter Alys, have been coaxed by the manipulative Livia to save the queen from the coming siege. The rewards are life-changing: the family could return to their beloved Tidelands, and Alinor could rule where she was once lower than a servant.<br><br> Alinor’s son is determined to stay clear of the war, but, in order to keep his own secrets in the past, Livia traps him in a plan to create an imposter Prince of Wales – a surrogate baby to the queen.<br><br> From the last battle in the desolate Somerset Levels to the hidden caves on the slave island of Barbados, this third volume of an epic story follows a family from one end of the empire to another, to find a new dawn in a world which is opening up before them, with greater rewards and dangers than ever before.<br><br><b>A compelling and powerful story of political intrigue and personal ambition, set between the palaces of London, the tidelands of Foulmire and the shores of Barbados.</b><br><br><b>Praise for <i>Dawnlands</i>:</b><br><br> ‘This sprawling, epic addition to the series will delight Gregory’s many fans' <b><i>The Times</i></b><br>  <br> ‘Fast-paced, gripping and meticulously researched, the latest novel from Philippa Gregory is historical fiction at its best ...' <b><i>Daily Express</i></b><br><br> 'Spellbinding’ <b><i>Woman’s Own</i></b><br><br> ‘I love falling into a Philippa Gregory novel, her vibrant take on historical events always brings past eras alive ...' <b><i>Platinum Magazine</i></b>",

In fact, Toby Carr didn't quite make it and died with 6 areas left to \"do\". The story is told from his notes, recordings and book outline by his sister Katie Carr. This is done very well - while I knew that the book had been finished by Katie Carr, I didn't realise until the end that she had actually written most of the chapters. The book is told in the first person and I hadn't quite grasped that it was Katie Carr writing as Toby Carr!\n\nIt's clear that Toby Carr was an experienced kayaker and, I think, quite a intrepid one.",

No stranger to weathering a storm after living with a rare life-limiting condition and facing the death of his brother, avid kayaker Toby Carr set out to explore the areas of the Forecast.<br><br>On a journey that took him to the harshest and most tranquil stretches of our sea, Toby found the real people, places and stories behind the familiar names and imagined environments of the well-loved BBC broadcast. From the wildness and peace of the sea, looking back at the land, Toby hoped to gain the strength and balance he knew nature could provide and to discover what anchors us to each other.<br><br>Written by Toby's sister Katie from his extensive notes and recordings after his untimely death, <i>Moderate Becoming Good Later</i> is both an epic adventure - sometimes choppy, constantly moving - and a personal voyage of discovery that includes old friends and new, plenty of wildlife, and the ever-present sea.</p>",
